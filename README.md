<h1 align="center">Web AI Examples</h1>

> [!NOTE]
>
> This project is part of (and also associate to) the [Project AIRI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi), we aim to build a LLM-driven VTuber like [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama) (subscribe if you didn't!) if you are interested in, please do give it a try on [live demo](https://airi.moeru.ai).
>
> We experiment HuggingFace models and Transformers.js APIs here in WebAI examples repository, where it helped to grow our technologies inside of the [Project AIRI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi) primary repository. Things like:
>
> - Real-time voice chat
> - Real-time visual understanding
> - Voice processing
> - Video frames processing
>
> were all born from here.

## Development

## Other examples about AI / Model inference from Project AIRI

- [WebAI Example Realtime Voice Chat](https://github.com/proj-airi/webai-example-realtime-voice-chat): 🎤💬 Full example of implementing ChatGPT's realtime voice from scratch with VAD + STT + LLM + TTS technology stack within almost one file!
- [🤗 candle Examples](https://github.com/proj-airi/candle-examples): Examples of using [🤗 candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) for inference AI models in Rust, you could think of it as an alternative and more transformers like library than [Burn Examples (this repository)].
- [Burn Examples](https://github.com/proj-airi/burn-examples): Examples of using [Burn.dev](https://burn.dev) for inference AI models in Rust, you could think of it as an alternative and more advanced library than [🤗 candle Examples].
